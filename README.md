# The island
This project involves programming a dynamic island model with a grid of locations, each populated with various plants and animals. Utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), all animal types derive from an abstract 'Animal' class, with behaviors common to all animals, and specialized methods for eating, reproducing, and moving. The project also incorporates multithreading, with scheduled thread pools for plant growth, animal life cycles, and system statistics. The island's state was regularly reported in the console using Unicode symbols for animal representation. OOP, Multithreading, ScheduledExecutorService, ExecutorService, Unicode, Collections
